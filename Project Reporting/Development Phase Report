# **Development Day 1 Report**

## **Summary**

Development Day 1 focused on configuring the Terraform Proxmox provider and establishing token-based authentication. The setup was validated through functional tests to confirm seamless interaction between Terraform and Proxmox.

---

## **Details**

### **Initial Issue**
- The original provider block in `main.tf` used user credentials instead of the API token, resulting in authentication failures (`401 errors`) during `terraform plan`.

### **Resolution**
- Updated the provider configuration to include the appropriate API token-based authentication parameters:
  ```hcl
  provider "proxmox" {
    pm_api_url         = "https://192.168.0.175:8006/api2/json"
    pm_api_token_id    = var.proxmox_user
    pm_api_token_secret = var.proxmox_password
    pm_tls_insecure    = true
  }
  ```
- Verified API connectivity using:
  ```bash
  curl -k -X GET "https://192.168.0.175:8006/api2/json/nodes" \
    -H "Authorization: PVEAPIToken=terraform@pam!new_token_id=<API_Token_Secret>"
  ```
- Initialized Terraform and confirmed successful validation using:
  ```bash
  terraform init
  terraform plan
  ```

---

## **Final Configuration**

The revised `main.tf` configuration includes:
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    proxmox = {
      source  = "telmate/proxmox"
      version = "3.0.1-rc6"
    }
  }
}

provider "proxmox" {
  pm_api_url         = "https://192.168.0.175:8006/api2/json"
  pm_api_token_id    = var.proxmox_user
  pm_api_token_secret = var.proxmox_password
  pm_tls_insecure    = true
}

resource "proxmox_vm_qemu" "test" {
  name         = "proxmox-connectivity-test"
  target_node  = "pve"
  vmid         = 9001
  clone        = 9000

  disk {
    storage = "RaidArray"
    size    = 4
    slot    = "scsi0"
    type    = "disk"
  }

  network {
    id     = 0
    model  = "virtio"
    bridge = "vmbr0"
  }

  memory = 1024
  cores  = 1
}
```

---

## **Outcome**
- Successfully authenticated Terraform with the Proxmox API using token-based credentials.
- Executed `terraform plan` without errors, confirming functional integration.

---

## **Next Steps**
1. Extend Terraform configurations for deploying multiple Proxmox resources.
2. Automate VM provisioning workflows using validated modules.
